•	For Airgead Banking, one of Chada Tech’s clients, I was requested to develop an investment application that would determine the compound interest accrued over any supplied length of time. The program would also take the input of amounts relating to the initial investment as well as monthly deposits and annual interest. Ideally, you could input these amounts and determine how much you would make after that length of time passed. However, this program does not account for inflation or other anomalous variables that may have been unforeseen at the time. This was a basic approach for investment strategies. 

•	The application was well commented, illustrating what variables pertain to what function allowing for ease of modification.

•	In a later version, it would not be too difficult to account for inflation or even taxed interest if such things were required. 

•	Perhaps the most challenging thing about writing this was thinking out how this might work together. 

•	Because this was not too difficult to write, I would be inclined to add my email for any support needed by others. (chopki7@gmail.com) 

•	The items learned in this, could come in handy when building an auction house program for an online game. 

•	As stated earlier, the comments were applied well enough to discern which part addresses what, as well, the code is evenly spaced out for best readability.
